I was given all the HTML and css styling before hand for this project. This project taught me about the timeout function and how important it is to keep trying if your first idea doesn't work.</p><a href="https://github.com/SebWatt/MITTMatch" target="_blank">See Code Here ></a></div></div><div class="project-box"><div class="project-head"><img src="Images/car-game.png" alt="."/><h3>Unity Racing Game</h3></div><div class="project-information"><p>I made this project in Unity around 2 years ago. I made this project using C#. I learned a lot about how to use the editor and how to build terrain. I also learned about AI pathing and spent a lot of time playtesting to make a working opponant to race against.</p></div></div><div class="project-box"><div class="project-head"><img src="Images/quiz-website.png" alt="."/><h3>History Quiz</h3></div><div class="project-information"><p>I made this project as a resepentation for a final project for History. In the website it covers the history of Canadian technology. I thought it would be a clever idea to make a quiz game to test if the reader actually read anything. I was following a tutorial but this was my first experience with JavaScript. I learned a lot about how to debug problems in this project.</p><a href="https://github.com/SebWatt/canadian-history-final" target="_blank">See Code Here ></a></div></div></div></section></main><footer>Â© Sebastien Watt, 2023</footer></body></html>
